# Office Documents

You can start by checking to see what kind of office file this is you are working with.

```
file OfficeFileName.xtension
```

This will give the version and office application for the file.

```
olevba OfficeFileName.xtension --deobf/decode/reveal
```

[Olevba](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/olevba) examines macros and more present without opening or executing the file.
