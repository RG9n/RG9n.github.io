# TryHackMe Write-Ups
You have came to the right place to learn about CTFs/Challenges! I am going through both the Offensive Pentesting (93%) and Cyber Defense (73%) learning path. I have already completed the CompTIA Pentest+ path, so I will most likely not be going back to do write-ups on those because I enjoy doing them while I am currently working on a room. For Red Team rooms, I will include my mitigations to secure the room from the route I used at the end of the write-up.
