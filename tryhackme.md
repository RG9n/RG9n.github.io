# TryHackMe Write-Ups
You have come to the right place to learn about CTFs/Challenges! I finished the Offensive Pentesting, and CompTIA Pentest+ paths and included write-ups for some of the CTFs I completed during them. I am going through the Cyber Defense (73%) learning path and will continue to do write-ups after the rooms are all released. For Red Team rooms, I will include my mitigations to secure the room from the route I used at the end of the write-up.
